This project focuses on simulating the performance of a battery over time, considering various
power usage modes such as idle, moderate, and performance levels. The simulation tracks the
battery's energy consumption and estimates the remaining time based on the current energy level
and power usage. A State of Charge (SoC) gauge is incorporated to visually represent the battery's
remaining capacity, providing real-time feedback on energy depletion. The data collected from the
simulation is then stored in a CSV file for analysis and future reference, allowing users to
understand and optimize battery performance for different operating conditions. This project aims
to enhance energy management and provide valuable insights into battery behavior for various
applications.
